## Inspiration

Today the Code Muse spoke to me and told me that I want to make an _Asteroids_-like game in Rust-to-WebAssembly titled _USS Uncommon Priors Require Origin Disputes_. You might think, "Another _Asteroids_ clone; isn't that going to be super-boring?!" (This is one of the standard App Academy exercises.) But programming AI for enemy ships could be fun! (You could have a dumb AI that fires at your current position (plus noise), and a smarter AI that looks at your velocity.)

## Premise

You are Cmdr. Robyn Hansen-Dale of the Federation science vessel USS _Uncommon Priors Require Origin Disputes_! The _Uncommon Priors_ has just been trapped in a pocket of twisted space with a toroidal topology. Do you have what it takes to surviveâ€”and escape?!
