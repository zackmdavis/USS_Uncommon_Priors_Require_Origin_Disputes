## Inspiration

Today the Code Muse spoke to me and told me that I want to make an _Asteroids_-like game in Rust-to-WebAssembly titled _USS Uncommon Priors Require Origin Disputes_. You might think, "Another _Asteroids_ clone; isn't that going to be super-boring?!" (This is one of the standard App Academy exercises.) But programming AI for enemy ships could be fun! (You could have a dumb AI that fires at your current position (plus noise), and a smarter AI that looks at your velocity.)

## Premise

You are Cmdr. Robyn Hansen-Dale of the Federation science vessel USS _Uncommon Priors Require Origin Disputes_! The _Uncommon Priors_ has just been trapped in a pocket of twisted space with a toroidal topology. Do you have what it takes to survive—and escape?!

Maybe peek at [similar work by Adolfo Ochagavía](https://aochagavia.github.io/blog/rocket---a-rust-game-running-on-wasm/) (not for game logic—I look forward to thinking that through on my own—but just for the WebAssembly setup that I _could not_ get working the other day.
